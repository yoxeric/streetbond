Zoot Man kicked off the madness when he tossed out a wild idea that quickly split the Zooters into warring factions. 
Roadman, Weeb, and Nsab lk7l found themselves pinned down in the middle, accused of treason by one side and idolized as heroes by the other. 
Yngin and Lrgin, already on edge, snapped and started throwing punches over which faction had the true vision, 
while Sayad just sat back, popcorn in hand, enjoying the spectacle like it was the best drama on TV. 
Meanwhile. 
Zak was pacing around, complaining about how everything was falling apart, but no one was listening to him as the chaos spiraled further.
it was Conman who fanned the flames. He pretended to be the peacemaker, spinning lies and manipulating everyone into thinking he was the one trying to stop the war. Meanwhile, he was secretly stirring the pot, making sure the chaos kept growing.
Alliances were shifting, insults flying, and the whole damn place was a ticking time bombâ€”if only anyone could get their act together long enough to stop it.
